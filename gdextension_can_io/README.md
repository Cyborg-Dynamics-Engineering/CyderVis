# GDExtension CAN I/O

This rust crate utilises the [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/) library to be compiled as a [GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/index.html), allowing [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) projects to read and write with CAN interfaces.
